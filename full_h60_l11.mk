# This file is the build configuration for a full Android
# build for maguro hardware. This cleanly combines a set of
# device-specific aspects (drivers) with a device-agnostic
# product configuration (apps). Except for a few implementation
# details, it only fundamentally contains two inherit-product
# lines, full and maguro, hence its name.
#
#

# Inherit from those products. Most specific first.
$(call inherit-product, $(SRC_TARGET_DIR)/product/full_base_telephony.mk)

# Inherit from h60-l02 device
$(call inherit-product, device/huawei/h60_l11/h60_l11.mk)

# Set those variables here to overwrite the inherited values.
PRODUCT_NAME := full_h60_l11
